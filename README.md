React Redux Boilerplate with server rendering
=============================================

A project boilerplate for applications that require [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/),
[Redux](http://redux.js.org/), [Redux-Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) and want to support
server rendering as well.

See [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) documentation for environment config etc.
